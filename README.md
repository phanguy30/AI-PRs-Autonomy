# Agentic Pull Requests: Automation and Human Interaction 

This repository contains our analysis of the [AIDev / Agentic Pull Requests dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/hao-li/AIDev).

The overall goal is to understand **when AI coding agents can handle pull
requests (PRs) fully automatically** and **when human participation is still needed**.

In the full project we plan to answer three research questions (RQs):

- **RQ1 – Automation extent:**  
  To what extent are PRs fully automated (all commits by bots and no human review)
  versus requiring human participation?

- **RQ2 – Work type and complexity:**  
  What types of work and what levels of PR size/complexity correspond to fully
  automated PRs compared to those that involve humans?

- **RQ3 – Bot-level differences:**  
  Which bots generate PRs that require the most human feedback or corrections?

## Data and Results After Cleaning

The `data/` directory contains the processed PR-level datasets generated by our
preparation pipeline. Each file corresponds to one of the three research
questions and provides the cleaned inputs used in the report.

### `data/pr_rq1.csv` — Automation Labels (RQ1)
One row per pull request, including:
- `pr_id`
- `level` — automation/interaction category  
  (0 = fully automated, 1 = human review only, 2 = human commits)
- additional PR metadata used in the RQ1 summaries

### `data/pr_rq2.csv` — Work Type & Complexity (RQ2)
One row per pull request, containing:
- `pr_id`
- `level` — same automation categories as RQ1
- `task_type` — feat / fix / docs / refactor / test / other
- `n_commits` - number of commits related to this PR
- `n_files` - number of files changed
- `lines_changed`- number of lines of codes changed

### `data/pr_rq3.csv` — Outcomes by Interaction Level (RQ3)
One row per interaction level (0, 1, 2), summarizing:
- `level`
- `n_pr` — number of PRs
- `accept_rate` 
- `median_turnaround_hours`
- `p25_turnaround_hours`
- `p75_turnaround_hours`
